# Tennis_Analysis

## Overview/Purpose
Using historical data from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the goal of this project is to determine probability of a player winning future matches. 

We will train a classification model using a sample of our test data in order to determine accuracy of the model. To prevent overfitting, we will use a larger variety of samples rather than restricting our training data to one particular tennis player, tournament, year etc.

## Communication Protocols
Our team is comprised of Brittani Baker, Fouad Ziaa, Kathy Ming & Stephen Pimentel. 
We've agreed to communicate openly, honestly and professionally. We've committed to assisting each other with all levels of the project, working together as a team to support each other's strengths rather than delegating work based on the suggested 'shapes' from Module 20. We communicate primarily via a Slack channel, have set up our individual Github branches for committing and have also implemented reoccurring Google meetings outside of classtime each week, as well as Google doc/slides.
