# Tennis_Analysis

## Overview/Purpose
Using historical data from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the goal of this project is to determine probability of a player winning future matches. We selected tennis as a topic of interest because we're interested in Roger Federer's professional career statistics. 


We want to show which factors determine the match outcome, such as: points at net, number of aces during match, first serve percentage, points won at first serve, or number of double faults. Our dashboard will have options to filter by different players for easy comparison. 

For example, does a players points won at first serve influence if that player will win the overall match? 

If we can show a relationship between certain factors and the player's chance of winning, can we then use our machine learning model to predict future match outcomes based on those data points? 


We will train a classification model using a sample of our test data in order to determine accuracy of the model. To prevent overfitting, we will use a larger variety of samples rather than restricting our training data to one particular tennis player, tournament, year etc.

## Communication Protocols
Our team is comprised of Brittani Baker, Fouad Ziaa, Kathy Ming & Stephen Pimentel. 
We've agreed to communicate openly, honestly and professionally. We've committed to assisting each other with all levels of the project, working together as a team to support each other's strengths rather than delegating work based on the suggested 'shapes' from Module 20. We communicate primarily via a Slack channel, have set up our individual Github branches for committing and have also implemented reoccurring Google meetings outside of classtime each week, as well as Google doc/slides.
